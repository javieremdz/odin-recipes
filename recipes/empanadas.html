        <h3>For the Beef Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (85-90% lean)</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, <em>peeled and minced</em></li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, <em>cored, seeded, and finely diced</em></li>
            <li>1/2 green bell pepper, <em>cored, seeded, and finely diced</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, <em>finely minced</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons tomato paste, <em>to preference</em></li>
            <li>1 small russet potato, <em>peeled, finely diced, and boiled*</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded monterey jack cheese, <em>optional</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>For the dough:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the water and butter, heating until butter has fully melted. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and paprika and make a well in the center. Pour a little of the warm butter mixture in and mix with your fingertips to make a wet paste. Pour in remaining liquid, and work the dough with your hands until you get a wet, oily dough. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the beef, cooking until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons of drippings.</li>
            <li>With the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons of drippings, sauté the yellow onion until translucent, 10-15 minutes. Then add the bell peppers, peas, garlic and seasonings.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, deglaze the pan with ¼ cup of beef broth, then add 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste (to preference).</li>
            <li>Once the tomato paste has dissolved, mix in the beef and potatoes. Remove from heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To assemble:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tear off golf-ball sized pieces of the chilled dough and roll into balls. On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the balls into 1/4-inch thick, 5-inch diameter circles. Once your dough has been rolled out, place 2 heaping tablespoons of filling in the center of each dough circle. Add ½ teaspoon scallions to each circle, and sprinkle lightly with cheese, if using. Brush a small amount of egg wash lightly over one half edge’s border. Fold over the dough to create a half-moon shape and press edges firmly to seal. Crimp edges with the back of a fork.</li>
            <li>Place empanadas onto the prepared baking sheet. Lightly beat together the egg and water. Brush the empanadas gently with the egg wash.</li>
            <li>Bake empanadas until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate leftovers either plastic wrapped or stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze cooked empanadas plastic wrapped in a resealable freezer bag or airtight container for up to 3 months. To reheat, unwrap as many empanadas as you want and warm through in a 300°F oven or toaster oven for about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
