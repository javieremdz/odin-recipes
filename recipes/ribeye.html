        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tender ribeye steaks cooked to juicy perfection is the best way to enjoy steaks at home (and it's not difficult to make)!</p>
        <p>This amazing cut of beef is definitely a favorite and in my opinion, one of the most flavorful out there. There is no need for special or fancy ingredients, just steaks, seasonings, a brush of oil, and a pat of butter for perfection.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ribeye Steak, <em>we like to use one without a bone</em></li>
            <li>Seasoning, <em>we like to use montreal seasoning</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring steaks to room temperature and season <em><b>per the recipe below.</b></em></li>
            <li>Heat grill to medium heat. Season steaks and grill them between 5 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on the desired done-ness.</li>
            <li>Remove steaks, dot them with butter, and allow them to rest about 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips for Perfection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If using frozen steak, be sure to let it fully thaw.</li>
            <li>Bring steaks to room temperature before cooking.</li>
            <li>A bit of vegetable or canola oil before seasoning helps the seasonings stick.</li>
            <li>Season steaks just before cooking.</li>
            <li>Preheat the cast iron pan, oven and/or grill.</li>
        </ul>
